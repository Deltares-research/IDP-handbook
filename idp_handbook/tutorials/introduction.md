# Introduction to the tutorials

In this chapter we provide tutorials on working with datasets used to assess coastal hazards and impacts. These datasets are cloud-optimized and are stored in STAC catalogs, allowing for efficient querying of large amounts of data. The main source of data in the tutorials is the IDP (CoCliCo) STAC catalog - for more information please refer to the [Data Catalog](../datasets/idp-stac-catalog.md) chapter.

The tutorials collection is under development. Several tutorials on data access are already available, see [data access tutorials](./data_access_tutorials.md).
