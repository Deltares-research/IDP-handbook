| Chapter                                       | Description |
| ---                                           | --- |
| Exploring coastal hazards and impacts         | This chapter provides contextual and introductory information on the different types of coastal hazards and their impacts, guiding the user to the respective storymaps or dashboards, allowing to obtain an overview and system understanding (without the need to engage with code). |
| Web viewer                                    | The web viewer serves as an entrypoint to visually explore (global) state-of-the-art datasets. It is equipped with a set of functionalities to explore the data, including the possibility to export PDF's on the "state of the delta" for a region of interest. |
| Tutorials                                     | This chapter is intended for the technical users and is the starting point for interacting with the available datasets in a flexible and hands-on way through Python code. It includes an introduction on how to set up the working environment and provides examples of accessing relevant cloud-optimized datasets from STAC catalogs. |
| Data catalog                                  | The data catalog provides an overview of the available datasets in the STAC catalog maintained at Deltares. This entails hazard, exposure & vulnerability as well as risk (impact) and adaptation datasets. |
