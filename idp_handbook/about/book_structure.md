# Book structure
Below is a brief summary of the chapter content. The full descriptions are present in the chapters and sections itself.

| Chapter                                       | Description |
| ---                                           | --- |
| Usage                                         | This chapter elaborates on the usage of the framework, providing details on how to get started and contribute among others. |
| Web viewer                                    | The web viewer serves as non-expert entrypoint to visually explore (global) state-of-the-art datasets. It is equipped with some basic functionalities to explore the data, including for instance the possibility to export PDF's on the "state of the delta" for a region of interest. |
| Exploring coastal hazards and impacts         | The workbench is split into two chapters, "Exporing coastal hazards and impacts" and "Tutorials". The former contains fully developed Storymaps and Dashboards, enabling a non-expert user to get more contextual information in case of storymaps. For somewhat more expert users, the Dashboards more flexibly (with respect to the web viewer) allow to detail very specific analysis of some datasets. |
| Tutorials                                     | Tutorials refer to the advanced / expert user domain of the workbench, where it is possible to (interactively) code against the datasets in the STAC. Here, there are examples how to approach the STAC (as well as external STACs) and work with different data formats. Also the code for the detailed workflows to derive data for the Storymaps and the Dashboards is available. |
| Data catalog                                  | The data catalog shows the different datasets in the STAC catalog maintained at Deltares. This entails hazard, exposure & vulnerability as well as risk (impact) and adaptation datasets. Besides, the manual elaborates on the process of ingesting data in the catalog yourself. |
| Resources                                     | Other usefull resources and links are provided in this chapter.   |
