# Data ingestion manual

## Introduction
This manual functions to inform users about the process of making datasets CF compliant and merging them into a Spatio-Temporal Asset Catalog (STAC). It involves quite some dataset dependent time-consuming data engineering, although it is envisaged to make the process itself as straightforward as possible. In the near future we will lower the threshold by connecting with the Deltares Data Management Suite.

Before diving into the data delivery workflow, some background information on STAC and CF compliancy is presented. After the data delivery workflow, a way to keep track of the progress, future vision on the topics described in this manual and the software environment are outlined.  

The manual is drafted as part of a European Union H2020 project called Coastal Climate Core Services (CoCliCo), from which it is using templates and workflows. CoCliCo runs until 2026 and hence this manual is subject to change. At the same time, various other internal initiatives use the spin-off from CoCliCo to FAIRify data and describe it in a STAC. An overview of these projects and their datasets (as well as progress) can be found here: Sharepoint Excel. Please always consider the latest version of this manual in the SharePoint and reach out to the writers in case anything is unclear, broken or not usable anymore.  

For using a STAC as data handling tool (for instance for visualization or other post-processing) please visit the ‘Remote Sensing Data Handling using Python’ course on the ET Sharepoint. Indicative course material and scripts are available on https://github.com/Deltares-research/py-sense.
